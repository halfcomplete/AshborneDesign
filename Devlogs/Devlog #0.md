# Devlog #0

Hi! I'm Eric, the solo dev for Ashborne, and you're reading my first EVER Devlog. It's called Devlog #0 because it's just an introduction to the project.
So, let's get started right away!

## What is Ashborne?
Ashborne is a fun Text RPG that really focuses on story, narrative, and player-driven consequences. You play as this character from an unknown
medieval-fantasy timeframe and you have to make choices in an ever-changing, Shakespearean-style world. However, I don't reject the mechanics of
traditional Text RPGs - Ashborne also has features like inventories, combat, exploring, and crafting, while still containing more story-related
features such as:
- branching dialogue with NPCs!
- emotional stats like guilt, fear, hope, or resolve!
- a world that remembers your actions!
- and a LOT more that is planned (which will be covered in the "Vision" section)

## Why is Ashborne?
Good question. I decided to make Ashborne one day when I was in English class learning about Shakespeare. I was pretty much immediately hooked 
on his style of writing, his play structure, and his imagination. I decided to take that fascination and combine it with my love for programming
and gamedev, which resulted in me going: "Huh, Ashborne is a pretty cool idea." However, on a much more serious note, Ashborne is my take at a
new method for educating people around the globe on proper, global issues that have been cemented into our society. No, not stuff like climate
change and pollution (although both are still quite important). I'm talking about:
- abuse of power,
- loss of identity, and
- the cycle of violence.
<br>These topics, I've found, are not often covered in schools nor even adult educational facilities - not in an engaging, relatable, and memorable way,
anyway. I want to change this, and to do this I've decided to create Ashborne.

### OK... but how does Ashborne help against these problems?
Those three problems mentioned above are the very three pillars that Ashborne is built upon. They are *everywhere* in the world of Ashborne, and
it doesn't take long for any player to find it. By placing the player in this world, in all sorts of circumstances, the game is simple asking them:
<br> "With the power to act... will you?"
<br> Or rather:
<br> "Can you?"
Ashborne is a medium for people to explore the consequences of their good, and bad, actions, and to discover how to make the world a better place.
<br> Abuse of power is presented through the exploitation of the player in the beginning, and through what happens later when the player receives the power
and the positions that they so hated before. Have they, then, become what they once hated? What they once feared?
<br> Loss of identity, or more generally, just identity, is presented through the idea of Masks (see "Vision" section). Who can they trust? Who can the
characters trust? And the player'll find out just how *easy* it is to completely ruin someone else's identity, image, and future.
<br> The cycle of violence is obvious in the world. It's also obvious in Ashborne. And the player has the power to stop it: and they might try, but
they can't stop it. Because it's not the individual that can change this, it's the world. So the player stops trying. And they start joining.
<br> These ideas are all shown in an accessible, safe, and explorable environment, which is my Vision for the game. So let's get into that.

## My vision for the game
I am planning to develop the game for at least a couple of years, maybe approaching 3 or 4 years. By the end of that time, Ashborne will be a
complete game that I hope will be released to a major fanbase. However, what I hope more, is that it is adopted as a "learning tool" for
people of all ages (except maybe tiny children) to experience our world's societal issues first-hand, see how they can be prevented, and
to bring those changes to the real world.

As for the features of the game, there will be 5 Acts in total (like how Shakespeare usually divided his plays into 5 Acts). Each Act will represent
a different theme or experience that the player goes through. However, progression is not strict and the player could stay for as long as they
wanted in a particular Act or make one decision to skip forward an Act. Each Act brings a changing world state, different options for the player,
and different character attitudes (as well as other cool, tiny changes that bring the world to life). Each Act is as follows:
- Act I: the player will feel trapped, powerless, and a victim of other characters
- Act II: this act begins when the player escapes from their previous predicament. Here friendships can be formed, enemies can be made, and much more
  important decisions that will affect the course of the story later will be presented
- Act III: this act begins when a major betrayal or negative event occurs. Friendships will break, others will form out of pure necessity, and the
  lines between moral and immoral blur. Here is when the player will have to make the majority of their no-win decisions. Here is also where the
  issues of the world are presented foremost, but the player is given no option other than to "go along with it".
- Act IV: this is defined by the easing of the chaos in Act III. The player will reflect on their previous actions, why they did it, and what they
  can do now. It is reflection time.
- Act V: one word, legacy. What will the player choose to leave behind?

All of these acts will be designed to challenge the player in some way, either morally, emotionally, or philosophically. Additionally, another major
feature that I'm dreaming about are **Masks**. Masks are the key mechanic that the game uses to create ideas about identity, particularly the loss
of it. The concept is simple: in this fantasy world, rich, famous and powerful people wear Masks. Masks are sentient beings that look like actual
non-sentient masks but can speak to the wearer's mind directly, and also are markers of identity. There's a finite amount of Masks, and any wearers
of the same Mask, no matter how different they are or were, or even if one is dead already, they are considered the same person. So person A wearing
Mask A is, to everyone in Ashborne, the same as person B who wears Mask A two days later. And if person A wears Mask B, then person A wearing Mask A
and person A wearing Mask B are two different people. The player, obviously, will most likely know better, but the game is designed so that most of 
what the player can deduce about who's who is pure guesswork (i.e., the game doesn't reveal anyone's specific identity). This creates more tension
and more challenges towards trust, and also introduces the key relation between Ashborne and the internet in terms of identity. After all, anyone
on the internet can be anyone else. We are all wearing Masks when we're online.

However, this can benefit the player as well. Wearing the Mask of their enemy can provide access to restricted areas, but they'll have to obtain
that Mask first. Plus, there's no such thing as Mask duplicates (although that may become a feature later). But this also means characters can
impersonate the player, which will lead to a lot of interesting interactions. Furthermore, finding the identity of someone underneath a Mask is
extremely valuable to their enemies, so people who Mask themselves usually never unmask in front of others in their entire life, but they may 
change masks, and may change often as well. That's Masks in a nutshell.

## Conclusion
Wow, you made it to the end! Is my Devlog really *that good*??? To conclude, Ashborne challenges:
- abuse of power, by giving the player power later and asking "what will *you* do with it?"
- loss of identity (especially on the internet), through Masks, and
- the cycle of violence, by connecting the player with characters and splitting them apart
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the read, and I hope you'll come along with me on this
multiple year-long journey, because the end sure will be *magnificent*.
